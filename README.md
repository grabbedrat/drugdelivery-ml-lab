Flask Computational Chemistry ML Lab for Drug Distribution
Welcome to the Flask Computational Chemistry ML Lab for Drug Distribution! This lab is designed to provide an interactive learning experience for upper division undergraduate students interested in exploring the applications of machine learning (ML) in drug discovery and distribution.
Overview
The lab consists of three main demos of increasing complexity, along with two extra ideas for further exploration. The demos cover the following topics:

Simple drug property prediction
Drug-target interaction prediction
Drug distribution and pharmacokinetic modeling

Extra ideas:

Drug repurposing and combination therapy
Drug toxicity and adverse effect prediction

Learning Objectives
By engaging with the lab, students will:

Understand the fundamental concepts of computational chemistry and ML in drug discovery and distribution.
Gain hands-on experience with ML models for predicting drug properties, interactions, and pharmacokinetics.
Develop insights into the real-world applications and challenges of ML in the pharmaceutical industry.
Enhance their critical thinking and problem-solving skills through guided exercises and reflections.
