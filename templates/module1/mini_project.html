<h2>Mini-Project: Building a Molecular Similarity Search Tool</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In the field of drug discovery, identifying compounds with structural similarity to known active molecules can be a powerful strategy for finding potential drug candidates. This mini-project will challenge you to build a molecular similarity search tool using Python and the powerful RDKit library.</p>

<p>Your task is to develop a user-friendly application that allows researchers to input a reference molecule and search through a database of compounds to find those with similar structures. This tool can be invaluable in the early stages of drug discovery, enabling researchers to explore the chemical space efficiently and prioritize compounds for further evaluation.</p>

<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<p>By completing this mini-project, you will:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Gain hands-on experience with molecular representations and similarity calculations using RDKit.</li>
    <li>Implement an efficient similarity search algorithm to identify structurally similar compounds.</li>
    <li>Develop a user-friendly interface for inputting reference molecules and search parameters.</li>
    <li>Visualize and present the search results in a clear and informative manner.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Data Preparation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Curate a database of molecules in SMILES format.</li>
            <li>Preprocess the molecules and generate suitable representations (e.g., Morgan fingerprints).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Similarity Search Algorithm</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement a function to calculate the similarity between two molecules using the Tanimoto coefficient.</li>
            <li>Develop a search algorithm to find the most similar compounds to a given reference molecule.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>User Interface</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a command-line interface for users to input the reference molecule and search parameters.</li>
            <li>Display the top-N most similar compounds along with their similarity scores.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Evaluation and Refinement</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Test the similarity search tool on a set of known similar compounds and assess its performance.</li>
            <li>Refine the algorithm and user interface based on the evaluation results.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started with the mini-project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Install the required dependencies, including Python and the RDKit library.</li>
    <li>Download the starter code and dataset from the provided link: <a href="module1_miniproject.ipynb" download>Mini-Project Notebook</a></li>
    <li>Open the Jupyter notebook and complete the tasks outlined in each section.</li>
    <li>Once you have completed the notebook, combine the code into a single Python script and test the final similarity search tool.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>To submit your mini-project, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Combine the code from the Jupyter notebook into a single Python script.</li>
    <li>Include a README file with instructions on how to run the similarity search tool and any dependencies required.</li>
    <li>Create a ZIP file containing the Python script, README file, and any additional files or datasets used.</li>
    <li>Upload the ZIP file to the designated submission portal or email it to the instructor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck with the mini-project! If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the instructor or your peers.</p>
