    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this section, we will introduce the importance of drug property prediction in the drug discovery and development process. We will focus on the prediction of solubility, a crucial property that affects the absorption and distribution of drugs in the body.</p>
    <p>The Delaney dataset, which contains experimental solubility values for a diverse set of compounds, will be used as our primary resource for building and evaluating machine learning models.</p>
