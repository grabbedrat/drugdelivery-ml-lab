    <h3>The Drug Discovery Pipeline</h3>
    <p>The drug discovery pipeline is a complex and multidisciplinary process that involves several key stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Target identification and validation</li>
        <li>Hit identification and lead generation</li>
        <li>Lead optimization</li>
        <li>Preclinical studies</li>
        <li>Clinical trials</li>
        <li>Regulatory approval</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each stage presents unique challenges and requires collaboration among experts from various fields, including biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and computational sciences.</p>
    <h3>Role of Computational Methods in Drug Discovery</h3>
    <p>Computational methods have become increasingly important in modern drug discovery, enabling researchers to navigate the vast chemical space more efficiently and make data-driven decisions. Some key applications of computational methods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Virtual screening and de novo drug design</li>
        <li>Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling</li>
        <li>Molecular docking and structure-based drug design</li>
        <li>ADME/Tox prediction and optimization</li>
        <li>Data integration and analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By leveraging computational tools and techniques, researchers can accelerate the drug discovery process, reduce costs, and increase the likelihood of success.</p>
    <h3>Challenges and Bottlenecks in Drug Discovery</h3>
    <p>Despite advancements in technology and computational methods, the drug discovery process still faces several challenges and bottlenecks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High attrition rates and low success rates</li>
        <li>Long timelines and high costs</li>
        <li>Complexity of biological systems and disease mechanisms</li>
        <li>Lack of predictive models and translational tools</li>
        <li>Regulatory hurdles and changing market dynamics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach, collaboration among stakeholders, and continuous innovation in both experimental and computational methods.</p>
