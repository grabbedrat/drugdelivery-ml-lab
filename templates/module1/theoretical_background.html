    <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
    <h3>Solubility and Its Significance</h3>
    <p>Solubility refers to the ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent, typically water in the context of drug development. The solubility of a drug molecule plays a crucial role in its absorption, distribution, and overall bioavailability.</p>
