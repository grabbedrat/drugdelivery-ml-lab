<h3>Lesson Content</h3>

<h4>Introduction to Molecular Representation</h4>

<p>Molecular representation is the process of encoding the structure and properties of a molecule in a format that can be easily processed by computers. There are several common methods for representing molecules, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System): A string notation for representing molecules based on their connectivity.</li>
    <li>InChI (International Chemical Identifier): A standardized, non-proprietary identifier for chemical substances.</li>
    <li>Molecular graphs: A graph-based representation where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Molecular Descriptors</h4>

<p>Molecular descriptors are numerical values that capture various aspects of a molecule's structure and properties. They are used as features for building machine learning models in drug discovery. Some common types of molecular descriptors include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>2D descriptors: Derived from the molecular graph, such as molecular weight, number of atoms, and topological indices.</li>
    <li>3D descriptors: Calculated from the 3D structure of the molecule, such as surface area, volume, and shape descriptors.</li>
    <li>Physicochemical properties: Descriptors related to the physical and chemical properties of the molecule, such as solubility, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.</li>
    <li>Fingerprints and structural keys: Binary vectors that encode the presence or absence of specific substructures or functional groups in the molecule.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Convert the following molecules from SMILES to InChI:
        <ul>
            <li>CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O (Aspirin)</li>
            <li>CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C)C(=O)N2C (Caffeine)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Calculate the following descriptors for the given molecules:
        <ul>
            <li>Molecular weight</li>
            <li>Number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors</li>
            <li>Topological polar surface area (TPSA)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
