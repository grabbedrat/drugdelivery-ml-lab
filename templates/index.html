    <h1>Welcome to the Flask Computational Chemistry ML Lab for Drug Distribution!</h1>
    
    <p>This lab is designed to provide an interactive learning experience for upper division undergraduate students interested in exploring the applications of machine learning (ML) in drug discovery and distribution.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The lab consists of three main demos of increasing complexity, along with two extra ideas for further exploration. The demos cover the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple drug property prediction</li>
        <li>Drug-target interaction prediction</li>
        <li>Drug distribution and pharmacokinetic modeling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Extra ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drug repurposing and combination therapy</li>
        <li>Drug toxicity and adverse effect prediction</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>By engaging with the lab, students will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the fundamental concepts of computational chemistry and ML in drug discovery and distribution.</li>
        <li>Gain hands-on experience with ML models for predicting drug properties, interactions, and pharmacokinetics.</li>
        <li>Develop insights into the real-world applications and challenges of ML in the pharmaceutical industry.</li>
        <li>Enhance their critical thinking and problem-solving skills through guided exercises and reflections.</li>
    </ul>
