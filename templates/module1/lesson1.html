<h3>Lesson Content</h3>

<h4>Introduction to Molecular Representation</h4>

<p>Molecular representation is the process of encoding the structure and properties of a molecule in a format that can be easily processed by computers. There are several common methods for representing molecules, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System): A string notation for representing molecules based on their connectivity.</li>
    <li>InChI (International Chemical Identifier): A standardized, non-proprietary identifier for chemical substances.</li>
    <li>Molecular graphs: A graph-based representation where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Molecular Descriptors</h4>

<p>Molecular descriptors are numerical values that capture various aspects of a molecule's structure and properties. They are used as features for building machine learning models in drug discovery. Some common types of molecular descriptors include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>2D descriptors: Derived from the molecular graph, such as molecular weight, number of atoms, and topological indices.</li>
    <li>3D descriptors: Calculated from the 3D structure of the molecule, such as surface area, volume, and shape descriptors.</li>
    <li>Physicochemical properties: Descriptors related to the physical and chemical properties of the molecule, such as solubility, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.</li>
    <li>Fingerprints and structural keys: Binary vectors that encode the presence or absence of specific substructures or functional groups in the molecule.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Molecular Fingerprints</h2>
    <p>
        Molecular fingerprints are a way of encoding the structure of a molecule. The most common type of molecular fingerprint is the binary fingerprint. This is a bit string (a sequence of 1s and 0s) where each bit represents the presence or absence of a particular substructure in the molecule.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many different types of fingerprints, such as topological fingerprints, circular fingerprints (like ECFP), and MACCS keys. The choice of fingerprint often depends on the specific application.
    </p>
    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>
        Given a molecule, generate its ECFP4 fingerprint and MACCS keys. Compare the two fingerprints. What differences do you notice? What could be the implications of these differences for similarity search and machine learning?
    </p>
    <h3>Additional Exercises</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>For high-level ML students:</strong> Use the generated ECFP4 fingerprints and MACCS keys to build a simple machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, etc.) to predict some property of the molecules (e.g., solubility, toxicity, etc.). Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC-ROC, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>For high-level chemistry undergraduates:</strong> Analyze the generated ECFP4 fingerprints and MACCS keys. What do the bits in these fingerprints represent? How do they capture the structure of the molecule? How could you use these fingerprints to compare the similarity between different molecules?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Free-form Exercise:</strong> Explore the use of other types of fingerprints (e.g., topological fingerprints, atom-pair fingerprints, etc.) or other machine learning models (e.g., neural networks, SVMs, etc.). What advantages or disadvantages do they have compared to ECFP4 fingerprints and MACCS keys? How do they affect the performance of the machine learning model?
